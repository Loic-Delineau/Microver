CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware
designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the freedom to use,
study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs and products based on
those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open Hardware Licence comes in three
variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W
(weakly reciprocal) and this licence, CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-S is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only. For more information, see <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cern-ohl-s-2.0/#>.
